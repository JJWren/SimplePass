# SimplePass
This program connects to the [WordsAPI](https://rapidapi.com/dpventures/api/wordsapi) through the RapidAPI domian via the Python Requests module.
With this, the user will be asked to input a number from 4 to 10. This number will be used to determine the number of words generated for the simple password.
All words will be at least 4 characters long and at a max length of 10. This means that the smallest possible password generated will be at least 19 characters long.

Any cybersecurity expert will be able to tell you that password length trumps that of password complexity.
Words are easier to remember than amalgamations like ["Tr0ub4dor&3"](https://xkcd.com/936/).

Brave browser uses this type of system to authenticate devices being synced for an account.

However, I would strongly recommend using a password manager like LastPass to manage your passwords!
